# Coding Preferences

- Ignore the gallop-protocol-game.html file.
- Do not start a Python server before checking if it's already running.
- If you see an opportunity for creating a manager go for it and add to /js/managers

## Dev Server

- Do not offer to start the server (i.e. `npm run dev` or `npm server`), only suggest it in plain text

## Reference

- Look inside README.md
